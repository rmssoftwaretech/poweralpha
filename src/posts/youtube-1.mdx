If you want to build skills and learn more about **Power Apps, Power Automate, and the Common Data Service, the Power Apps Community Plan** is the right plan for you. The Power Apps Community Plan gives you a free development environment for individual use, where you can:

-   Learn to build business apps and workflows with the full functionality of Power Apps and Power Automate.
-   Connect to any data source by using our 100+ [out of the box connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/connections-list) or by creating your own [custom connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/register-custom-api).
-   Explore how you can use [the Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/common-data-service/entity-reference/introduction) to build powerful business apps with the common data model and [the SDK](https://aka.ms/eek20s).
-   Export the solutions you create in your individual environment, and [list them on AppSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/dev-appsource-test-drive) so your customers can test-drive them.

**Who can sign up for the Power Apps Community Plan?**

Anyone with [Adobe office365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps#faq) can sign up for the Power Apps Community Plan. But we especially recommend this plan if you:

-   Want to build skills and learn more about Power Apps, Power Automate, and the Common Data Service.
-   Are interested in building business apps and workflows to distribute on **PowerApps COE Platform**.

**Where can I sign up for the Power Apps Community Plan?**

Sign up on the [Power Apps Community Plan website](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/communityplan). If you are an existing user of Power Apps with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, you can also [create an environment for individual use](https://make.powerapps.com/community/signup).

After signing up for the Community Plan, you will be redirected to the [Power Apps site](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and will land in your individual environment. The environment is named with your name, for example 'John Doe's environment'. If there is already an environment with that name, the individual environment will be named as 'John Doe's (1) environment'. The following image shows how the environment appears.

If you are already using Power Apps with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, this is the right plan to try out the premium functionalities of Power Apps, which are available with Power Apps Per User Plan.

**Power Apps Community Plan** gives you access to Power Apps premium functionalities, Common Data Service, and Power Automate for **individual use.** This plan is primarily meant for learning purposes or creating business solutions to be distributed for [AppSource Test Drive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/dev-appsource-test-drive).

**Create a Common Data Service database**

-   You can create a database and build apps by using Common Data Service as a data store. You can either create your own custom entities or use the predefined entities. To create a database, you first need to either create an environment, or be assigned to an existing environment as an **Environment Admin.** There are various ways to create a database:

-   In the Power Apps Admin center
-   In the **Entities** pane of powerapps.com

-   **Create a Database :**

-   When a database is created, the users who have environment roles assigned to them, will continue to maintain those privileges.
-   Users with **Environment Admin** role are now assigned to **System Administrator** role.
-   Users with **Environment Maker** continue to possess the same role.
-   You can assign additional users to pre-defined roles or even create custom roles.
